**ADS OF-DFT V.3 Julia Scripts**

The Julia scripts for fitting and validating the empirical coefficients of the Exange and Correlation (XC) and Kinetic Energy (KE) functionals can be accessed in the folder ``Julia Scripts``.

The reference KS-DFT calculations, using B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, can be accessed in the folder ``Reference Data``. In this folder the input and output files are all available, and also the Python script used to create the input files. These input files can be run using Psi4.

In the directory ``Validation Data`` a few triatomic systems are explored to see if our model can reproduce the same results as KS-DFT calculationsm with B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, despite it not having any three-body contribution terms.
